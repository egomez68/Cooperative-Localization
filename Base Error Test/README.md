## Overview
Use these sketches to calculate the baseline error in each GPS receiver at the known latitude and longitude hard-coded into each of the Arduino sketches.
These hard-coded values were given to the team by the surveyors, who told us the ground truth for each stake. See the Excel spreadsheet entitled
"Stake Locations" for the known latitude/longitude, DD MM SSSS, and DD MM MMMM, of all the stakes, with notes as to their locations:
north most stake, north RSU, at east stop sign, in west lane, etc.
