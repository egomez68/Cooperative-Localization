## Overview

Arduino sketch used for the mobile nodes, who do not know their known location, but recieve data from other mobile nodes and the RSUs in
the network. Once the mobileNode sketch is run, go through the data saved on the SD card and compare your latitude and longitude of that
specific unit with the known latitude and longitude of the stake that the specific unit was placed at. You should see the error in the latitude and
longitude converge to zero, as seen in the simulations.
